<br/>I couldn't tell him I couldn't breathe
<br/>I never knew that I was ripping at the seams
<br/>I couldn't hold back I didn't try
<br/>One look and you're right between my lines
<br/>It's like you're diving in to my heart
<br/>I'm floating off the ground
<br/>When you pull me in to your arms
<br/>I go into a free fall
<br/>I'm spinning and I can't stop
<br/>I lose my breath when you say my name
<br/>I go into a free fall
<br/>I'm spinning and I can't stop
<br/>I lose myself and I'm not the same
<br/>When we're in a free fall
<br/>We're in a free fall
<br/>Never felt like this before
<br/>Got the thrill and now I only want more
<br/>Scared to look down but gravity
<br/>Can't compete with all the light you give in me
<br/>It's like you're diving in to my heart
<br/>I'm floating off the ground
<br/>When you pull me in to your arms
<br/>I go into a free fall
<br/>I'm spinning and I can't stop
<br/>I lose myself and I'm not the same
<br/>I go into a free fall
<br/>I'm spinning and I can't stop
<br/>I lose myself and I'm not the same
<br/>When we're in a free fall
<br/>I go into a free fall
<br/>I'm spinning and I can't stop
<br/>When we're in a free fall
